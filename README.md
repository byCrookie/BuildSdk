# BuildSdk
BuildSdk is a custom build sdk for msbuild. It automaticly generates nuget packages for release/debug with automatic versioning for debug. After a successful build the nuget package is published to a local or public nuget-feed.

## How to use
:warning: **Packages**: Packages are not working at the moment, please build the project yourself using the sourcecode.

## Docs
BuildSdk makes it very easy to have a local or public prerelease flow. It generates automatic prerelase versions for packages. The BuildSdk nuget-package has to be added to a project. That is everything needed.
